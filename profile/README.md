## Hi there 👋

We are **MAD Producer**, aiming to become a leading comprehensive MAD information platform in China.

### 🙋‍♀️ What we do
MAD Producer focuses on building an open, long-term information hub for the MAD / AMV community.  
We organize and maintain structured resources around MAD creation and events, including:

- MAD contest information & calendars  
- MAD teams and organizations  
- MAD Docs and knowledge bases  
- Beginner guides and community references  

Our goal is to make MAD-related information easier to find, more organized, and more sustainable for creators and communities.

### 🌈 Get involved
We welcome contributions from the community, including:
- Documentation improvements
- Data updates (contests, teams, archives)
- Tooling, scripts, or infrastructure-related projects
- Community-driven resources and translations

If you're interested, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

We do not charge users or creators for access.
